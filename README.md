# KaNuker
This is an Educational Tool

A powerul Kahoot Bot Spammer

## Features

KaNuker (v1) is very simple - pick your game (PIN), Bot-name (has a random string of numbers attached at the end to prevent duping), the amount of bots that join, and the cooldown between bots. 

## Package

I've supplied an EXE for quick off-the-bat launches. However, if you are uncomfortable running an EXE ive supplied the source code in `main.py` 
If you still don't want to run the .py on your computer, you can run it online if you find an interpreter that supports the imports.

## Safety

The program itself is safe. Decompile it, check it, it's clean. 

## Forking

I'm happy if you want to add to the project! Please - if you have suggestions send them in the Issues tab - if you want to implement stuff fork it!
