### üõ°Ô∏è "Windows protected your PC" Warning

When launching the EXE, Windows may show a **"Windows protected your PC"** message. This happens because the file isn‚Äôt from a verified publisher.
#### Verifying the EXE would cost up to $300 USD a year.

To run it anyway:
1. Click **"More info"**
2. Click **"Run anyway"**

> üí° This is normal for unsigned EXE files. The program is safe ‚Äî you can inspect the source code or decompile the EXE to verify.

### üß™ Antivirus & VirusTotal Flags

You might notice the EXE gets flagged by **Windows Defender** or shows warnings on **VirusTotal**. Here's why:

#### ‚ùì Why is this happening?

- **The EXE is generated from Python using tools like PyInstaller**, which package your script and Python interpreter into one file. This technique is sometimes abused by malware authors ‚Äî so antivirus engines often flag **any** such EXEs as "suspicious."
- **The file is unsigned**, meaning there‚Äôs no digital signature proving it came from a trusted source.
- **Low reputation**: Since this is a new and custom-built tool, it hasn‚Äôt been downloaded or whitelisted much, so automated systems assume it's risky by default.

#### üõ†Ô∏è But is it actually malicious?

**No. The source code is included** in the repo (`main.py`) ‚Äî feel free to:
- Read it
- Run it directly in Python
- Compile it yourself using tools like `pyinstaller`

If you‚Äôre still unsure, **you can upload your own compiled version to VirusTotal** to compare with mine.

> üí° False positives are very common with small Python tools packaged into EXEs. If in doubt, run the `.py` directly!



## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

KaNuker v1 keeps it simple and effective:
- üî¢ Enter a Kahoot Game PIN  
- üß† Choose a base name (each bot gets a unique random suffix)  
- ü§ñ Pick how many bots to send  
- ‚è± Set a cooldown delay between each join

## üì¶ Installation & Usage

### üîÅ Quick Start (Windows Users)

Grab the latest **EXE release** [here](https://github.com/ILikeCodingg5565/KaNuker/releases) and run it‚Äîno Python knowledge needed.

### üêç Python Enthusiasts

Prefer running the source?

1. Clone the repo or download `main.py`
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

> üí° You can also use any online Python interpreter **(with support for `kahoot` imports)** if you‚Äôd rather not run this locally.

## üîí Safety

This project is clean and open.  
**No malware, no surprises.**  
Feel free to inspect the source or decompile the EXE if you want peace of mind.

## üõ£ Roadmap & Future Plans

Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs cooking:

### ‚úÖ Smarter Name Generation  
Less obvious bot names = better trolling.
Currently bot names are `name_xxxx` where 'xxxx' is a 4 digit number.

### üöÄ Faster Bot Launching  
Current performance is decent but could be quicker. Optimization on the way!

### üì° More Advanced Control Panel (v2?)  
GUI or TUI options for easier use? Maybe!
