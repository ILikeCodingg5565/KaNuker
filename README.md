KaNuker is a **powerful Python-based Kahoot bot spammer** made for educational and experimental purposes only. Launch waves of bots into any game with custom settings, and watch the lobby light up.

## üõ£ Roadmap & Future Plans

Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs cooking:

### ‚úÖ Smarter Name Generation  
Less obvious bot names = better trolling.
Currently bot names are `name_xxxx` where 'xxxx' is a 4 digit number.

### üöÄ Faster Bot Launching  
Current performance is decent but could be quicker. Optimization on the way!

### üì° More Advanced Control Panel (v2?)  
GUI or TUI options for easier use? Maybe!
