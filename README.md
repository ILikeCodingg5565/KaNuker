# KaNuker
This is an Educational Tool

A powerul, Kahoot Bot Spammer made in Python

## Features

KaNuker (v1) is very simple - pick your game (PIN), Bot-name (has a random string of numbers attached at the end to prevent duping), the amount of bots that join, and the cooldown between bots. 

## Package

I've supplied an EXE for quick off-the-bat launches [here](https://github.com/ILikeCodingg5565/KaNuker/releases). However, if you are uncomfortable running an EXE ive supplied the source code in `main.py` - MAKE SURE TO INSTALL `requirements.txt` and run 
```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
If you still don't want to run the .py on your computer, you can run it online if you find an interpreter that supports the imports.

## Safety

The program itself is safe. Decompile it, check it, it's clean. 

## Forking

I'm happy if you want to add to the project! Please - if you have suggestions send them in the Issues tab - if you want to implement stuff fork it!


## Future Ideas

Obviously, this project has a lot of quick potential, mainly because a lot of Kahoot bots have been taken down.

Heres a basic roadmap of what I want to try and do.

### Better Name Randomization

Make better randomization, very easy to do

### Quicker Load

Currently the bot can take a bit of time to load - I want to speed this up.

[@vehbiu](https://github.com/vehbiu), thankyou so much :)
You made this possible - without your `kahoot` python package this would have been a lot harder
